- Kickoff inperson meeting

2022-Aug-3
- Paper on image recovering with ranks

2022-Aug-17
- Code working, show some examples
(1) RGB 
(2) Radial image (missing projections)

2022-Aug-31
- Grayscale vs RGB, are there crosstalks? Why does RGB with less known recover better grayscale?
(1) *Order (e.g. every other pixel) and with random (e.g. 80% of the 50%)
(2) *Gray (set depth=1)
(3) *Recover RGB vs. Recover individual channels and combine
(4) *Combine 3 different images into one RGB and try recover
(5) *Compare same image, repeat multiple random and then recover 
(6)* Learning speed, p; 
- Random within 2*2 performs better than total random? 
*(7) Try 1/(3*3) etc to test the limit
(8) Verify with HXN data
*9 Error metric definition: value threshold 2.5 instead of 10
